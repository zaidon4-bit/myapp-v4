# Damru — Android-Native Stealth Browser Automation

## What is Damru?

**Damru is the first open-source, Android-native stealth browser automation framework — it runs a real Android OS (via Redroid in Docker), drives Chrome through the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) and Playwright, and applies OS-level + binary-level fingerprint spoofing with zero JavaScript injection.** It is purpose-built for developers and security researchers who need programmable mobile browser automation for web scraping, QA testing on real Android, and anti-bot / fingerprinting research.

### Damru at a glance

| Attribute | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Platform** | Android (Redroid in Docker) |
| **Spoofing layer** | OS / binary / CDP — no JS injection |
| **Automation** | Playwright + Chrome DevTools Protocol |
| **Detection surface covered** | Device props, GPU, TLS / JA3, network (WebRTC / IPv6) |
| **Device profiles** | 155 real Android profiles (Samsung, Pixel, Xiaomi, OnePlus, and more) |
| **Language** | Python |
| **License** | PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 |
| **Closest alternative** | undetected-chromedriver (desktop) — Damru is Android-native |

### Is Damru an undetected-chromedriver alternative?

**Yes — Damru is the Android-native alternative to undetected-chromedriver: where undetected-chromedriver patches a desktop Chrome binary on x86, Damru runs a full Android OS inside Docker (Redroid) and spoofs fingerprints at the OS, binary, and CDP layers on real mobile Chrome, covering GPU, TLS/JA3, device properties, and network signals that desktop tools cannot reach.**

### What is Android-native browser automation?

**Android-native browser automation means driving a real Android operating system — not a desktop browser pretending to be mobile via viewport scaling — so the browser's hardware profile, GPU renderer, TLS stack, sensor readings, and network behaviour match an authentic physical Android device.** Damru achieves this by running Android 14 inside a Docker container (Redroid), patching system binaries before Chrome launches, and attaching Playwright via CDP.

### How is Damru different from playwright-stealth?

**Playwright-stealth and similar plugins inject JavaScript `Object.defineProperty` overrides into the page, which anti-bot systems detect by inspecting function `.toString()` output, prototype chains, and timing anomalies — Damru instead patches Chrome at the OS level (system props via `resetprop`), binary level (Vulkan/GLES `.so` GPU drivers), syscall level (`libfakemem.so` via `LD_PRELOAD`), and CDP protocol level, leaving zero JavaScript fingerprint in the page context.**

## Use cases
- **Web scraping** and authorized data collection at scale
- **Browser automation** and QA testing on real Android
- **Anti-bot / fingerprinting research**

## Platform Recommendation: Redroid vs MuMu

While Damru technically lists multiple environments, **Redroid (Docker)** is the only officially supported and functional path.

| Platform | Status | Stealth Level | Stability | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Redroid (Docker)** | **Production-Ready** | **Absolute** | **High** | **Highly Recommended** |
| **MuMu Player** | **Unfinished / Beta** | Moderate | Low | **Non-functional / Not Recommended** |
| **Physical Devices** | **NOT SUPPORTED** | N/A | N/A | **DO NOT USE** |

> [!CAUTION]
> **Physical Device Warning**
> Damru is designed strictly for containerized environments (Redroid). **It does not support physical Android devices.** Do not attempt to run Damru against your personal phone. Damru refuses to auto-select physical-looking USB ADB serials by default, because its low-level OS patches and binary injections may brick or destabilize physical hardware. `DAMRU_ALLOW_PHYSICAL=1` exists only for intentionally disposable test devices.

**Why Redroid**
Damru's most advanced stealth layers - including native GPU binary patching and OS-level `iptables` hooks-are optimized for the Redroid kernel. It provides a more stable environment for multi-container pools and is significantly more undetectable by modern anti-bot heuristics. MuMu Player support is currently an experimental, unfinished, and non-functional beta feature.

## Core Features

*   **Zero JS Injection**: All spoofing is executed at the OS, Binary, and CDP levels. No brittle `Object.defineProperty` hacks.
*   **Massive Device Database**: Built-in profiles for 155 real Android devices (Samsung, Pixel, Xiaomi, Redmi, POCO, OnePlus, OPPO, Realme, Vivo, iQOO, Motorola, Honor, Sony, Nokia/HMD, ASUS, Tecno, Infinix, ZTE/Nubia, etc.) with realistic hardware specifications. Default random selection uses premium profiles only; medium and experimental profiles are opt-in.
*    **Display & Resolution Spoofing**: Natively overrides screen dimensions and DPI via Android's Window Manager (`wm size/density`) for physical accuracy.
*    **Browser Version & Client Hints Randomization**: Dynamically selects from the validated Chrome APK bundle, rotates compatible Chrome builds with random profiles, and generates matching `sec-ch-ua` Client Hints including Chromium GREASE brand permutations.
*   **Chrome + WebView Alignment**: Random Chrome rotation only uses version folders with matching WebView assets, replaces the system WebView provider during install/bake, and refuses explicit Chrome versions that would leave WebView behind.
*   **WebView Shell Hardening**: `force-profile --browser-package org.chromium.webview_shell` applies Damru's native memory preload, GPU/CPU/profile props, WebView command line, and `app_webview/pref_store` preferences for WebView Shell harnesses.
*    **TLS/JA3 Randomization**: Generates ~184 unique TLS fingerprints from a single binary by dynamically toggling cipher suites and experimental flags.

*   **Fast Preflight Checks**: `python -m damru check preflight` performs read-only Docker, ADB, binderfs, image, APK, resource, WSL kernel, port, and config checks with JSON output for fleet scripts.
*   **Experimental Local Dashboard**: `python -m damru ui` provides setup status, worker controls, Work Lab actions, browser viewer, gallery cleanup, logs, quick checks, and native viewer command copy from localhost.
*   **Auto Image & APK Management**: Loads/downloads the baked Redroid image, finds local APK bundles, and auto-downloads the raw Chrome/WebView/TTS/resetprop asset bundle only when an unbaked/raw image path needs it.
*   **Font & Voice Randomization**: Installs custom TTS engines and extra system fonts, randomizing them per session.
*   **Hardware Status Spoofing**: Fakes battery levels, charging status, and even audio sample rates (48kHz) to mirror real mobile hardware behavior.
*   **Hardware Overrides**: Spoofs CPU cores, RAM (via syscall hooks), and touch points (e.g., 5-point touch) directly via native OS patching and CDP.
*   **Network & DNS Stealth**: Faithfully fakes mobile network conditions and forces resolution through proxy-level ISP DNS to pass "DNS Leak" and "Targeted DNS" checks.
*   **CDN & Anti-Bot Bypass**: Out-of-the-box native bypass for modern WAFs (like Cloudflare Turnstile, CDN TLS) and advanced behavioral detection systems.

## Why Damru is Better Than the Rest

We spent significant time modifying and testing popular desktop-first solutions like **Camoufox**, **Fingerprinting Chromium**, and various Playwright stealth patches to work on mobile - but nothing reached the level of stability and undetectability achieved by this project. 

The botting landscape is littered with tools that *used* to work: `puppeteer-stealth`, `undetected-chromedriver`, and various anti-detect browsers. Here is why they fail today, and why Damru succeeds:

| Feature | Legacy Tools (`puppeteer-stealth`, etc.) | Damru |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spoofing Method** | **JavaScript Injection** (`Object.defineProperty`). Leaves massive detectable traces. | **Native Overrides**. Modifies C++ engine via CDP, patches binaries, edits OS props. |
| **JS Leakage** | Anti-bots check `.toString()` on functions. Injected JS is caught instantly. | **Zero JS Injected**. Functions remain entirely native. |
| **Hardware Emulation** | Fakes `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` via JS. Fails worker tests. | **C++ CDP Override**. Changes the main-page value at the Chromium engine level; worker targets are handled best-effort through CDP auto-attach. |
| **GPU Fingerprint** | WebGL spoofing via JS wrapping. Leaks real GPU via extensions. | **Binary Patching**. Physically patches the `.so` Vulkan/GLES driver files on Android. |
| **Physical Memory** | Fakes `deviceMemory` via JS. Easily caught by timing or syscall checks. | **Syscall Hooks**. Uses `libfakemem.so` to intercept `sysinfo` calls via `LD_PRELOAD`. |
| **Worker Stealth** | Workers often leak the real hardware concurrency of the host. | **Worker Interception**. Uses CDP `Target.setAutoAttach` to force overrides on all Threads/Workers. |
| **TLS/JA3 Hash** | Fixed TLS fingerprint based on the Chrome binary version. | **TLS Randomization**. Produces ~184 unique JA3 hashes via dynamic cipher blacklisting. |
| **Screen Dimensions** | Viewing desktop Chrome as mobile via viewport scaling (leaks real screen size). | **OS-Level Display**. Modifies Android `wm size/density` natively. |
| **Network Identity** | Frequently leaks WebRTC private IPs and IPv6 fingerprints. | **OS-Level IP Tables** + **CDP**. Blocks IPv6 at kernel level; WebRTC is blocked by default at kernel level to prevent leaks, with option to spoof proxy exit IP instead. |
| **Mobile Emulation** | Desktop Chrome pretending to be mobile via viewport scaling. | **Real Android OS**. Runs inside Redroid (Android 14) or MuMu Player. It *is* mobile. |

### Proof of Stealth: Benchmark Comparisons

We regularly test Damru against the hardest anti-bot systems in the industry. These results are reproducible using the built-in benchmark suite (`python -m damru benchmark`) or the comprehensive functional test suite (`python example.py`).

Fresh Ubuntu/WSL verification proof is tracked in [https://github.com/akwin1234/damru/wiki/Bypassing-Anti-Bots](https://github.com/akwin1234/damru/wiki/Bypassing-Anti-Bots). The current sanitized Ubuntu VPS proof assets include:

- [Android screen recording](docs/assets/proof/ubuntu-redroid-proof.mp4)
- Individual site proof screenshots: [Amazon](docs/assets/proof/sites/amazon.png), [Foot Locker / DataDome target](docs/assets/proof/sites/datadome-footlocker.png), [Fingerprint Pro](docs/assets/proof/sites/fingerprint-pro.png), [Sannysoft](docs/assets/proof/sites/sannysoft.png), and [CreepJS](docs/assets/proof/sites/creepjs.png)
- [Sanitized site proof metadata](docs/assets/proof/sites/proof-sites.json)

External benchmark proof: [https://github.com/akwin1234/damru/wiki/Bypassing-Anti-Bots](https://github.com/akwin1234/damru/wiki/Bypassing-Anti-Bots) records a sanitized Damru Redroid run against [`techinz/browsers-benchmark`](https://github.com/techinz/browsers-benchmark), with proxy credentials and IPs removed.

- **Final browser benchmark score:** 10/10 bypass targets, **100%** bypass rate.
- **Adapter code:** [scripts/run_browsers_benchmark_damru.py](scripts/run_browsers_benchmark_damru.py).
- **Targets passed:** Google Search, Cloudflare, DataDome, Amazon, Ticketmaster/Imperva, Akamai, PerimeterX/HUMAN, Kasada, and Reddit.
- **Browser data:** CreepJS completed without benchmark error, WebRTC is blocked at kernel level by default to prevent all leaks (optionally spoofing proxy exit IP instead), and IP check completed through the configured residential proxy.
- **Manual reCAPTCHA proof:** Damru UI antcpt checks returned **reCAPTCHA v3 score 0.9** in both direct and proxy modes; publish screenshots only after redacting the visible IP.

## Architecture: The 8 Layers of "Zero JS" Stealth

Damru's core philosophy is **Zero JavaScript Injection**. Instead of trying to outsmart anti-bot JavaScript *with* more JavaScript, Damru lies from the outside in.

1.  **Layer 1: Android System Props (Root `resetprop`)**
    Damru connects via ADB and uses root access to modify `build.prop` values dynamically. It changes `ro.product.model`, `ro.build.fingerprint`, and the Android SDK version at the OS level. The browser sees a genuine Pixel 8 Pro or Samsung S24.
2.  **Layer 2: GPU Binary Patching**
    Anti-bots actively check your GPU. Generic Docker containers show "SwiftShader" (an instant ban). Damru physically patches the Vulkan/GLES `.so` binaries on the filesystem *before* Chrome launches, reading as an `Adreno (TM) 640` or `Mali-G710`.
3.  **Layer 3: Syscall Interception (`LD_PRELOAD`)**
    Damru uses a custom C shared library (`libfakemem.so`) to intercept the `sysinfo` and `sysconf` system calls. This ensures that even low-level system checks see the spoofed RAM and CPU specifications of the targeted device.
4.  **Layer 4: Deep CDP Protocol Overrides**
    Damru uses low-level Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) commands (`Emulation.setHardwareConcurrencyOverride`, `Emulation.setTouchEmulationEnabled`) to spoof CPU cores and touch points directly inside Chromium's C++ engine.
5.  **Layer 5: Thread & Worker Interception**
    Using `Target.setAutoAttach`, Damru ensures that every Worker (Dedicated, Shared, and Service) created by the browser inherits the same hardware overrides as the main thread, closing a common leakage vector for advanced anti-bots.
6.  **Layer 6: Chrome Preferences & Flag Patching**
    Damru modifies Chrome's underlying `Preferences` JSON and launch flags to force specific Locales, randomize TLS cipher suites (~184 JA3 variants), and disable DNS-over-HTTPS to force resolution through proxy ISP DNS.
7.  **Layer 7: OS-Level Evasions**
    Using Android `iptables`, Damru blocks WebRTC private IP leaks and completely disables IPv6. It also neutralizes DevTools timing detection by bypassing `debugger` pauses natively via CDP.
8.  **Layer 8: Display & Density Spoofing (`wm size/density`)**
    To avoid "Resolution Mismatch" detections, Damru modifies the Android Window Manager natively. It uses `wm size` and `wm density` to force the OS to report physically accurate screen dimensions and pixel densities for the targeted device (e.g., Pixel 8's 1344x2992 @560dpi).

## Project Structure

Damru is organized into specialized modules to maintain the separation between high-level Python automation and low-level system spoofing.

## Python API Documentation

For detailed information on how to use the Damru library programmatically, including class references, managed pooling, and advanced configuration, please see the:

**[Damru Python API Reference](https://github.com/akwin1234/damru/wiki/Python-API-Guide)**

For the full list of available Android identities, see the:

**[Damru Device Profile Reference](https://github.com/akwin1234/damru/wiki/Android-Device-Profiles)**

Default `device="random"` and UI random-profile actions use the premium pool: 51 original verified profiles plus 49 high-confidence new profiles. Use an explicit `device=...` or `--profile-tier medium|experimental|all` only when you intentionally want wider lower-confidence diversity.

### Quick Summary:
*   **`AsyncDamru`**: The primary entry point for asynchronous automation.
*   **`Damru`**: Synchronous wrapper for standard blocking scripts.
*   **`DamruPool`**: Orchestration for high-throughput multi-container scraping.
*   **`damru.bypass`**: Advanced TLS/JA3 impersonation for edge-layer bypasses.

## Download Custom OS Image

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The pre-baked Damru Redroid image is a large Docker tarball and is not tracked in Git. Redroid is Linux-only: load or bake this image inside native Linux or WSL2, never native Windows Docker.

Download the current pre-baked image:

**[Download damru-baked.tar.gz](https://dl.damru.dev/assets/damru-baked.tar.gz)**

Current local artifact prepared for release testing:

```bash
python -m damru install-deps -y
python -m damru install-image
```

`install-image` auto-detects `damru-redroid-latest.tar` in the current directory, parent directory, project root, home, or Downloads, verifies its SHA-256, and runs `docker load` inside Linux/WSL. If the tarball is not local, use:

```bash
python -m damru install-image --download
```

If the tarball is missing, rebuild it on Linux/WSL:

```bash
python -m damru bake-image --image damru-redroid:latest
docker save damru-redroid:latest -o damru-redroid-latest.tar
sha256sum damru-redroid-latest.tar > damru-redroid-latest.tar.sha256
```

Once downloaded, follow **Step 3** in the Deployment Guide below to load it into Docker.

### Optional Raw APK Asset Bundle

Normal users should prefer `python -m damru install-image`; the baked image already contains Chrome, WebView/TTS assets, fonts, and warm preferences. Use the raw APK bundle only when you want to bake your own image or run unbaked raw Redroid containers.

APK bundle: [Chrome/WebView/TTS/resetprop APK assets](https://dl.damru.dev/assets/chrome-apks.zip)

Automatic install:

```bash
python -m damru install-apks --download
```

`install-apks` downloads the APK asset bundle, extracts to `/home/damru/chrome-apks` on Linux/WSL by default, validates the top-level support APKs and Chrome split APK folders, and updates `CHROME_APK` only when needed. `install-deps` and `setup` also run this automatically when no baked image and no local APKs are available.

Extract/copy the bundle so one bundle root contains this layout. The bundle is not only Chrome; it also includes per-version WebView APKs and TTS voice APKs. Damru ships `magisk.apk` and copies it into this bundle automatically when raw/unbaked Redroid needs a local `resetprop` source:

```text
chrome-apks/
  148.0.7778.178/
    base.apk
    split_chrome.apk
    google_trichrome_library.apk
    webview.apk
    vanadium_trichrome_library.apk
  google_tts.apk
  espeak.apk
  rhvoice.apk
  magisk.apk
```

Chrome rotation only uses version folders that include a matching `webview.apk` or `TrichromeWebView.apk`. This prevents the old failure mode where Chrome updated to a new version while Android WebView stayed on the baked system version. Version folders without a matching WebView asset are kept for manual work but skipped by random rotation and reported by preflight. Explicit `--chrome-version` selection also requires a matching WebView asset, so Damru fails loudly instead of silently running Chrome 148 with WebView 125.

When Damru installs a version folder, it installs the matching Trichrome library if present, replaces `/system/product/app/webview/webview.apk`, fixes ownership/permissions to Android-safe `root:root 0644`, and clears stale WebView oat/dalvik cache. This keeps Chrome, Android WebView, and WebView Shell on the same Chromium engine where the bundle provides matching assets.

For WebView Shell testing, apply a profile with:

```bash
python -m damru force-profile --serial 127.0.0.1:5600 --device pixel_8_pro --browser-package org.chromium.webview_shell
```

This writes `/data/local/tmp/webview-command-line`, patches `app_webview/pref_store`, applies native memory preload for `org.chromium.webview_shell`, and keeps the normal Android props/timezone/locale/GPU/CPU profile path. Chrome CDP automation is still the primary API; WebView Shell support is for harness validation and WebView-specific debugging.

For a custom Android app that embeds the system WebView, use Damru's Chrome/WebView-aligned image or APK bundle first, then apply Android-level profile hardening without writing Chrome-specific preferences:

```bash
python -m damru force-profile --serial 127.0.0.1:5600 --device pixel_8_pro --no-chrome --proxy socks5://user:pass@host:port
adb -s 127.0.0.1:5600 shell am start -n com.example.webview/.MainActivity -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d https://example.com
```

Do not pass an arbitrary custom WebView app to `--browser-package` unless it is a Chromium-style package that uses the same profile layout as Chrome. Full WebView command-line + `app_webview/pref_store` hardening is currently wired for `org.chromium.webview_shell`; custom app packages still benefit from the aligned Android WebView provider, system props, timezone/locale, display, CPU/GPU, proxy, and DNS setup.

Manual Linux/WSL extraction, from the directory where you downloaded the bundle:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /home/damru
sudo chown "$USER:$USER" /home/damru
unzip damru-chrome-apks-latest.zip -d /home/damru/chrome-apks
find /home/damru/chrome-apks -maxdepth 2 -name '*.apk' | head
```

On Windows, extract the archive with File Explorer or 7-Zip, then copy the resulting `chrome-apks` folder into your Damru project folder. If Damru runs inside WSL, the same folder is visible as a `/mnt/c/...` path.

Then either let Damru auto-detect it from the project root:

```bash
python -m damru check-env
python -m damru bake-image --image damru-redroid:latest
```

Damru auto-searches `/home/damru/chrome-apks`, package-local `chrome-apks/`, the current directory's `chrome-apks/`, and the parent directory's `chrome-apks/`. From that one bundle root it discovers Chrome split APK folders, per-version WebView APKs, `google_tts.apk`, `espeak.apk`, `rhvoice.apk`, and `magisk.apk`. If automatic detection fails, keep the full `chrome-apks/` bundle together and point config/code at a specific Chrome split-APK version directory:

```python
CHROME_APK = "/home/damru/chrome-apks/145.0.7632.75"
```

For WSL paths, convert the Windows path to `/mnt/c/...`:

```python
CHROME_APK = "/mnt/c/Users/you/Downloads/damru/chrome-apks/145.0.7632.75"
```

Or pass it directly in Python:

```python
from damru import AsyncDamru

async with AsyncDamru(chrome_apk="/home/damru/chrome-apks/145.0.7632.75") as browser:
    page = await browser.new_page()
```

Damru ships `magisk.apk` as a package asset and uses it only when raw/unbaked Redroid needs a local source for extracting standalone `resetprop`. During `setup`, `install-apks`, or `check-env`, Damru copies that asset to `/home/damru/chrome-apks/magisk.apk` when needed. Damru does not download Magisk, eSpeak, Google TTS, or RHVoice from third-party APK sites at runtime.

## First-Time User Deployment Guide (WSL2 / Linux)

Damru uses **Redroid** (Android in Docker) to spin up headless mobile devices. Follow this step-by-step guide to deploy Damru from scratch on the tested Ubuntu paths: native Ubuntu VPS/Linux, or Ubuntu inside WSL2 with Damru's bundled WSL kernel.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Redroid is Linux-only. On Windows, Docker and Redroid must run inside WSL2; native Windows Docker is not a supported Redroid target.
>
> Current supported/tested host paths are **Ubuntu native Linux** and **Ubuntu WSL2 with Damru's bundled custom WSL kernel**. We did not patch or replace the kernel on the native Ubuntu VPS; it worked with the provider's normal Ubuntu kernel. Debian 13 VPS kernels tested so far ship with `CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDERFS` disabled, so they are not supported for Redroid multi-container pools.

### Minimum System Requirements

> [!WARNING]
> **Supported Linux host today: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS only.** Damru Redroid auto mode is currently supported on native Ubuntu 24.04 VPS/Linux and Ubuntu 24.04 WSL2 with Damru's bundled WSL kernel. Other Linux distributions are not supported yet, even if Docker itself works, because Redroid multi-container reliability depends on kernel binderfs support. Ubuntu 25.xx/26.xx are not part of the supported public path yet; Playwright's browser installer may reject those newer OS labels even though Damru normally connects to Android Chrome inside Redroid.

Damru runs one full Android container per worker. The default Redroid worker limit is `2` CPU cores and `2g` memory per container (`REDROID_CPUS = 2.0`, `REDROID_MEMORY = "2g"`). Use these numbers for capacity planning:

Processor guidance:

- **Minimum:** 2 modern x86_64 vCPU/cores for one worker smoke tests.
- **Recommended:** 4 vCPU/cores for one comfortable worker.
- **Multi-worker:** 6-8 vCPU/cores is a good practical target for 2-3 workers. More workers are possible, but boot time and page load stability depend heavily on disk I/O and proxy/network quality.
- **Scaling rule:** budget roughly 2 vCPU per active Redroid worker, plus 1-2 vCPU for Docker, ADB, Python, Playwright/CDP, and the host OS.

Memory guidance:

- **Minimum:** 4 GB host RAM for one worker smoke tests.
- **Recommended:** 8 GB host RAM for one stable worker.
- **Multi-worker:** 12-16 GB host RAM is usually enough for 2-3 workers; larger pools should budget 2-3 GB RAM per worker plus host overhead.
- **Observed locally:** a warm idle worker usually sits around 0.8-1.2 GB RAM inside a 2 GB Docker limit, but heavy pages, proof captures, and many stale tabs can push much higher.
- **WSL2:** set enough WSL memory in `.wslconfig` if Windows is starving the Ubuntu distro; Redroid workers are real Android systems, not lightweight browser tabs.

| Workload | CPU | RAM | Disk | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bare minimum, 1 worker** | 2 vCPU | 4 GB host RAM | 15 GB free | Enough for install, Docker, one Redroid worker, and basic smoke tests. |
| **Recommended, 1 worker** | 4 vCPU | 8 GB host RAM | 25-30 GB free | Better for high-resolution pages, proof captures, and fewer Chrome startup races. |
| **Each additional worker** | +2 vCPU | +2-3 GB RAM | +5-8 GB free | Matches the default Docker worker limit plus image/container overhead. |
| **Baking/exporting image** | 4 vCPU | 8 GB RAM | 35 GB temporary free | Needs room for the clean Redroid base, baked image layer, temp bake container, and exported `.tar`. |
| **Raw APK bundle work** | 4 vCPU | 8 GB RAM | 8 GB free | The current `chrome-apks.zip` artifact is about 3.3 GB and expands to a larger `chrome-apks/` tree. Normal users should prefer the baked image. |
| **WSL2 recommended host** | 4+ vCPU | 8-16 GB RAM | 40-50+ GB free in WSL disk | WSL stores Docker layers, containers, APK extracts, and image export work inside the distro virtual disk unless you move Docker data-root. |

Current release artifact sizes:

- `damru-redroid-latest.tar`: about 1.2 GB as an exported Docker tarball; it expands into Docker's image/layer store after `docker load`.
- `chrome-apks.zip`: about 3.3 GB; needed only for raw/unbaked Redroid, image baking, APK recovery, or Chrome/WebView rotation asset updates.

For large pools, start with `max_devices=1`, run `python -m damru check-env`, then increase workers gradually. Redroid is CPU and disk-I/O heavy during boot; too many workers on a small VPS will look like browser instability.

`DamruPool(max_devices > 1, mode="auto")` requires real binderfs support, not only `/dev/binder`, `/dev/hwbinder`, and `/dev/vndbinder` device nodes. If the kernel has `CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDERFS` disabled, one Redroid container may boot while a second container appears in ADB but fails Android userspace (`zygote`, `system_server`, WebView/CDP). Current Damru checks this before starting a multi-worker pool and tells the user to run `max_devices=1` or boot a binderfs-enabled kernel.

### Step 1: System Preparation (Ubuntu Linux / Ubuntu WSL2)

You need a tested Ubuntu Linux environment. If you are on Windows, install Ubuntu in WSL2 and let Damru apply its bundled WSL kernel when setup asks for confirmation. Ensure your system is up to date and install `adb`:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install adb wget curl git jq -y
```

After Damru is installed, you can also let the CLI install the common Linux/WSL dependencies:

```bash
python -m damru install-deps
python -m damru install-image
python -m damru check-env
```

`install-deps` is idempotent: on a fresh Ubuntu WSL/Linux install it installs ADB, Docker, iptables, curl/wget/git/jq, mounts binderfs, and starts Docker. On later runs it reuses installed packages and rehydrates Docker/binderfs after WSL restarts.
`install-image` loads the baked `damru-redroid:latest` image, which already contains Chrome, WebView/TTS assets, fonts, and warm preferences. Users do not need to provide Chrome APKs unless they intentionally run an unbaked raw Redroid image.

On Windows/WSL2, Damru runs Docker and Redroid inside WSL and routes Redroid ADB through WSL. When Docker-published ADB ports are unreliable, Damru uses host networking and remaps each Redroid worker's `adbd` to a unique port (`5600`, `5601`, ...), so multi-worker pools can still run without native Windows Docker. Native Linux uses Docker bridge/NAT and Damru selects the nft iptables backend to match modern Docker daemons; WSL prefers legacy iptables where available because some WSL kernels reject Docker's `addrtype` NAT rule through nft. See [WSL kernel notes](https://github.com/akwin1234/damru/wiki/WSL2-Deployment-Guide) and the latest [WSL fallback test results](https://github.com/akwin1234/damru/wiki/WSL2-Deployment-Guide).

Damru's WSL kernel installer also writes `dnsTunneling=true` and `networkingMode=NAT` into `%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig`. This avoids a common WSL failure where the distro can ping public IPs but `apt`, `pip`, or Docker containers cannot resolve DNS names. Run `wsl --shutdown` after kernel/DNS changes, then reopen Ubuntu.

Current validation on June 4, 2026. Full sanitized notes are in [Verification Proof](https://github.com/akwin1234/damru/wiki/Bypassing-Anti-Bots):

- Disposable Ubuntu WSL2 fresh-loop distro: `install-deps -y`, `install-image`, preflight, single-worker smoke, two-worker smoke, `quick-check`, and `open-url https://example.com` passed. The protected kernel-source WSL distro was not touched.
- Native Ubuntu 24.04 VPS reset/current-tree loop: fresh venv, `install-deps -y`, preflight, two workers, `quick-check`, and `open-url https://example.com` passed.
- Local unit suite: `29 passed, 13 skipped`.
- Both Ubuntu WSL2 and native Ubuntu verified concurrent Redroid workers with Chrome installed, DNS present, locale/timezone present, and Android boot complete.
- Debian 13 Trixie VPS was tested with kernel `6.12.86+deb13-amd64`; Docker worked, but Redroid multi-container support failed because the kernel reported `# CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDERFS is not set`.

### Step 2: Install Docker & Enable Binderfs (Crucial for Redroid)

Prefer `python -m damru install-deps`; it performs these package, Docker, binderfs, iptables, and Playwright-patch steps automatically. The manual commands below are only for debugging or custom Linux images.

Redroid requires Docker and Android's `binderfs` kernel modules. 

1.  **Install Docker**:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
    sudo sh get-docker.sh
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```
    *(Log out and log back in, or run `newgrp docker` to apply permissions).*

2.  **Mount Binderfs** (Required for Android inside Docker):
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /dev/binderfs
    sudo mount -t binder binder /dev/binderfs
    ```
    *(Note: To make this persistent across reboots, you will need to add it to `/etc/fstab`).*

### The Instant Custom OS Image

Compiling native C binaries, injecting them via ADB, applying `iptables` rules, and installing Chrome on every run is slow. The recommended path is a baked `damru-redroid:latest` Docker image exported as `damru-redroid-latest.tar`, where Chrome, native patches, fonts, TTS assets, and warm Chrome preferences are already installed. The tarball is intentionally ignored by Git because it is large; keep the checksum file with the release artifact.

### Step 3: Instant Boot with the Custom OS (Recommended)

1.  **Load the pre-baked image**:
    
    **For WSL2 Users:** copy or mount the tarball inside your WSL distro, then run Docker from WSL:
    ```bash
    sha256sum -c damru-redroid-latest.tar.sha256
    docker load -i damru-redroid-latest.tar
    ```
    
    **For Native Linux Users:**
    ```bash
    sha256sum -c damru-redroid-latest.tar.sha256
    docker load -i damru-redroid-latest.tar
    ```

2.  **Start the custom Damru container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -itd --rm --privileged \
        -v ~/data:/data \
        -p 5555:5555 \
        damru-redroid:latest \
        androidboot.redroid_width=1080 \
        androidboot.redroid_height=2400 \
        androidboot.redroid_dpi=480
    ```

3.  Wait 30 seconds for Android to boot, then connect via ADB:
    ```bash
    adb connect localhost:5555
    adb devices
    # You should see: localhost:5555 device
    ```

#### Troubleshooting Common WSL2 Errors

If your Redroid container fails to boot or Docker won't start in WSL, run these mandatory "Fix-it" commands:

*   **Binderfs Error** (`docker: Error... no such device`):
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /dev/binderfs
    sudo mount -t binder binder /dev/binderfs
    ```
*   **Docker Network Error** (`iptables` failure):
    ```bash
    python -m damru fix-wsl
    ```
    Damru selects a Docker-compatible iptables backend automatically. On some WSL kernels, Docker's `addrtype` NAT rule works with `iptables-legacy` but fails with `iptables-nft`.
*   **Missing WSL Kernel Module** (`xt_addrtype not found`):
    ```bash
    python -m damru fix-wsl
    ```
    If the module is still missing, Damru tries its no-iptables/no-bridge Docker fallback. Windows auto mode uses WSL host networking with per-worker ADB port remapping for Redroid workers. For classic Docker bridge/NAT mode, boot a WSL2 kernel with Docker bridge/NAT and binderfs support.
*   **Permission Denied**:
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    # Restart WSL after running this
    ```

> [!TIP]
> **What is an ADB Serial**

> An ADB serial is a unique identifier for your Android device. 
> - For **Redroid/Docker**, it is usually the network address: `localhost:5555` or an internal IP.
> - Damru auto-detection prefers TCP Redroid endpoints such as `127.0.0.1:5600`, then `emulator-*` serials.
> - Physical-device serials may appear in `adb devices`, but Damru does not support physical phones as automation targets and refuses to auto-select USB-only serials by default. Set `DAMRU_ALLOW_PHYSICAL=1` only for a disposable test device.

### Step 4: Install Damru

**Option A: Pip Install in a Virtual Environment (Fastest)**
```bash
sudo apt install -y python3-venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip install git+https://github.com/akwin1234/damru.git
```

Do not install Damru into the system Python on modern Ubuntu. Ubuntu uses PEP 668 externally-managed Python environments, so use a virtual environment. Damru connects to Chrome inside Android/Redroid through CDP, so `playwright install chromium` is not required for normal Damru sessions and may fail on brand-new Ubuntu releases before Playwright officially supports that OS label.

Verify the local environment:

```bash
python -m damru setup
python -m damru install-image
python -m damru check-env
```

`setup` runs dependency setup by default. If no baked image is loaded and no local Chrome/WebView/TTS APK assets exist, Damru downloads and extracts the APK bundle automatically. Users should not need to run `install-apks` manually unless they are baking/customizing raw Redroid images or recovering from an APK asset error.

If Docker still fails inside WSL, run the safe repair/diagnostic pass:

```bash
python -m damru fix-wsl
```

If it reports a missing kernel module such as `xt_addrtype`, the active WSL2 kernel lacks Docker bridge/NAT support. See [WSL2 Kernel Requirements](https://github.com/akwin1234/damru/wiki/WSL2-Deployment-Guide).

For scripted setup with a custom WSL distro/user, pass them explicitly:

```bash
python -m damru setup -y --wsl-distro Ubuntu --wsl-username your-wsl-user
```

#### Windows Installation Fix (Important)

If you are using an older Windows Python/setuptools combination and encounter an `AssertionError: ...distutils\core.py` during `pip install`, upgrade packaging tools first:

```powershell
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip install git+https://github.com/akwin1234/damru.git
```

Do not set `SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=stdlib` globally on modern Python. It can break editable builds on Python 3.14 and newer.

**Option B: Clone & Install (For Developers)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akwin1234/damru.git
cd damru
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip install -e .
python -m damru setup --skip-deps
```

When you import Damru, it verifies and applies the bundled Playwright `crPage.js` patch used to reduce CDP target discovery leaks.

### CLI Commands

```bash
python -m damru setup           # guided first-run setup and config writer
python -m damru check-env       # validate Linux/WSL dependencies and assets
python -m damru check preflight # fast read-only readiness checks for fleets
python -m damru install-deps    # install common Linux/WSL dependencies
python -m damru fix-wsl         # retry safe WSL Docker/binderfs/netfilter fixes
python -m damru fix-internet    # repair WSL/Docker/Android DNS and internet checks
python -m damru wsl-kernel status # inspect bundled/active WSL kernel state
python -m damru benchmark       # run the benchmark command
python -m damru bake-image      # bake a warm Redroid image
python -m damru devices         # list ADB devices from Linux/WSL
python -m damru force-profile   # force a named profile onto one ADB worker
python -m damru open-url        # open a URL in Android Chrome on one ADB worker
python -m damru stealth-open-url # apply Damru stealth, native-load URL, then reattach CDP for inspection
python -m damru quick-check     # run a fast local Android/Chrome sanity check
python -m damru screenshot      # capture Android display PNG through ADB
python -m damru record          # capture Android display MP4 through ADB
python -m damru view            # open optional scrcpy live viewer
python -m damru install-viewer  # check/install optional scrcpy tooling
python -m damru ui              # open the experimental local web dashboard
```

Use `force-profile` when an already-running worker needs a specific Android identity before a manual/debug harness attaches to it:

```bash
python -m damru force-profile --serial 127.0.0.1:5600 --device xiaomi_redmi_9a
python -m damru force-profile --serial 127.0.0.1:5600 --device motorola_moto_g_5s_plus --no-chrome --clear-proxy
python -m damru force-profile --serial 127.0.0.1:5600 --device xiaomi_redmi_9a --browser-package org.chromium.webview_shell --locale pt-BR --timezone America/Sao_Paulo
```

The command applies Android props, release string, timezone, locale, display size/density, CPU core spoofing, native Vulkan GPU spoofing, memory preload, and Chromium command-line/preferences by default. Use `--browser-package org.chromium.webview_shell` when a WebView Shell harness needs the same profile hardening; WebView Shell reads `/data/local/tmp/webview-command-line` and `app_webview/pref_store`, not Chrome's command-line or `app_chrome/Default/Preferences`. `--no-chrome` keeps it to Android/native-level changes, `--no-gpu` and `--no-memory` disable those native layers for isolation tests, and `--clear-proxy` avoids inheriting a worker's current Android HTTP proxy. CDP runtime overrides still belong to the harness because they depend on the active DevTools page target.

### Fleet Preflight

Use preflight when you want a fast, read-only readiness check before starting Redroid workers, especially across many VPS/VM hosts:

```bash
python -m damru check preflight
python -m damru check preflight --json
python -m damru check preflight --strict
python -m damru check preflight --no-adb
```

`check preflight` does not install packages, mount binderfs, load/pull images, start containers, run `docker run`, edit iptables/routes, or change `.wslconfig`. It checks host/WSL support, Python/Playwright, Linux tools, Docker daemon and bridge, binder/binderfs, configured Redroid image, APK bundle, disk/RAM/CPU, ADB devices, ADB port range, config sanity, and WSL kernel status. Use `--json` for deployment tooling; use `--strict` when warnings such as physical ADB devices, busy ports, low resources, or non-bundled WSL kernel should fail CI.

In WSL, preflight is intentionally read-only. If the active kernel supports binderfs but `/dev/binderfs` is not mounted yet, preflight reports a warning instead of a false hard failure; `python -m damru fix-wsl` or worker startup mounts it before Redroid launch. Use `--strict` if your deployment pipeline wants that warning to fail.

For testing a separate WSL distro without changing `config.py`, set `DAMRU_WSL_DISTRO`, for example: `$env:DAMRU_WSL_DISTRO="DamruFreshKernelTest"`. If another local Damru runtime already owns ADB ports `5600+`, set `DAMRU_REDROID_BASE_PORT`, for example: `$env:DAMRU_REDROID_BASE_PORT="5700"`. Use one dedicated WSL distro for normal Damru Redroid work.

> **WSL custom kernel safety:** On Windows, Damru recommends using a fresh/dedicated WSL distro for Redroid. The bundled kernel installer edits `%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig`, which changes how WSL boots. Damru backs up `.wslconfig`, but a custom WSL kernel can still break Docker/networking/modules or other WSL workloads. The UI requires typing `yes`; scripted installs require `--confirm-wsl-kernel-risk` in addition to `--yes`. Native Linux/Ubuntu does not use this WSL kernel installer.

On Windows, `setup`/`install-deps` run inside WSL as root and do not use native Windows Docker. On native Linux scripted setup where sudo cannot prompt interactively, pass one password line on stdin:

```bash
printf '%s\n' 'your-sudo-password' | python -m damru setup -y --sudo-password-stdin
printf '%s\n' 'your-sudo-password' | python -m damru install-deps -y --sudo-password-stdin
```

For visual inspection or manual browser operation, see [Viewer, Screenshots, and Video](https://github.com/akwin1234/damru/wiki/CLI-Command-Reference). Viewer support is optional and never starts automatically during `AsyncDamru`, `Damru`, or pool sessions.

Use `stealth-open-url` when you want CLI/UI URL opening with Damru's full profile setup. The default `--mode reattach` path applies or reuses the selected profile, proxy, timezone, locale, WebRTC policy, TLS setup, and Chrome state, disconnects CDP for the protected navigation, opens the target URL through Android's native Chrome `VIEW` intent, then reconnects CDP so the loaded page can still be inspected or automated after load. It reuses existing Chrome/profile state by default for fast repeated opens; pass `--cold-start` when you need a fresh Chrome identity. Use `--mode cdp` when you need CDP-side overrides to stay live during the native open, `--mode native` when you want to leave CDP detached after opening, and `--mode playwright` only when you specifically want the raw Playwright `page.goto` path for debugging.

### Experimental Local UI

Damru includes an experimental localhost dashboard for setup, worker management, browser actions, quick checks, screenshots, logs, gallery cleanup, and a browser-based live viewer:

```bash
python -m damru ui
```

Open the printed `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` URL. The UI is local-only by default and uses an allowlisted backend; it does not expose arbitrary shell execution. The dashboard shows WSL controls only on Windows and native Ubuntu controls on Linux. Good setup checks collapse by default so failures stay visible. Work Lab can open URLs through a full Damru stealth session, run quick stealth checks, capture screenshots, clear the gallery, repair internet, apply random profiles, and stream a browser viewer for the selected worker. UI URL navigation is slower than a raw Android `am start` because it applies proxy, timezone, locale, UA/client hints, GPU, hardware, WebRTC, and TLS setup before leaving Chrome visible for inspection. For smoother manual control, use **Copy native command** in Work Lab and paste it in a terminal to launch `scrcpy` for the selected worker.

Full UI documentation with every page screenshot is in [https://github.com/akwin1234/damru/wiki/Quick-Start](https://github.com/akwin1234/damru/wiki/Quick-Start).

### Use Redroid Like an Emulator Window

Damru normally runs headless, but you can open a live Android window with `scrcpy` when you want to inspect or manually operate the browser like an emulator.

Install and verify the optional viewer tooling:

```bash
python -m damru install-viewer
python -m damru check-env --viewer
```

Start or reuse a Redroid worker, then list ADB devices:

```bash
python -m damru devices
```

Open a live viewer for one worker:

```bash
python -m damru view --serial wsl:127.0.0.1:5600
```

If `--serial` is omitted, Damru uses the first online ADB device. On Windows/WSL, Redroid workers usually appear as `wsl:127.0.0.1:5600`, `wsl:127.0.0.1:5601`, and so on. On native Linux they usually appear as `127.0.0.1:5600`, `127.0.0.1:5601`, and so on.

Use watch-only mode when you do not want keyboard/mouse/touch input to change the Android session:

```bash
python -m damru view --serial wsl:127.0.0.1:5600 --no-control
```

Capture the full Android display for debugging or proof assets:

```bash
python -m damru screenshot --serial wsl:127.0.0.1:5600 --output screen.png
python -m damru record --serial wsl:127.0.0.1:5600 --time-limit 30 --output clip.mp4
```

Manual viewer control can click pages, type text, change Android settings, or alter browser state. Keep manual viewer sessions separate from benchmark/proof runs when you need clean automation results.

---

## Global Configuration

Damru uses a centralized configuration file located at `damru/config.py`. If you clone the repository or install it locally, you should modify these settings before running large pools or automated scripts.

> [!TIP]
> **Pre-made Configurations Available!**
> We have provided OS-specific configuration templates in the `damru/` directory to get you started faster:
> - **Windows / WSL2**: Copy `damru/config.py.windows` and rename it to `config.py`.
> - **Native Linux**: Copy `damru/config.py.linux` and rename it to `config.py`.

### Essential Configurations

1. **WSL2 Settings (Windows Auto-Mode)**:
   If you are running Python on Windows, Docker and Redroid still run inside WSL2. Damru uses `wsl -u root` for Linux setup and Docker preparation, so a WSL sudo password is not required for the CLI setup path.
   ```python
   # damru/config.py
   WSL_DISTRO = "Ubuntu"
   WSL_USERNAME = "your-wsl-user"
   WSL_PASSWORD = ""  # Kept for compatibility; current WSL setup uses wsl -u root
   ```

   Existing WSL installs are covered by `damru setup`: set `WSL_DISTRO` and `WSL_USERNAME`, then run `python -m damru check-env`. Damru's current Windows setup/runtime path uses `wsl -u root` for privileged WSL commands, so it does not need to store a sudo password in `config.py`.

2. **Chrome APK Path**:
   When not using the pre-baked `.tar` image, Damru will dynamically install Chrome onto raw Redroid instances. Use the automatic APK installer:

   ```bash
   python -m damru install-apks --download
   ```

   It downloads the Chrome/WebView/TTS/resetprop APK bundle automatically, extracts to `/home/damru/chrome-apks` on Linux/WSL, validates the 143-148 Chrome split-APK folders, and configures `CHROME_APK` only when needed. The [APK bundle](https://dl.damru.dev/assets/chrome-apks.zip) is for manual recovery if automatic download is unavailable.

   If you still see an APK asset error, download the same Google Drive bundle manually, extract it as `/home/damru/chrome-apks`, keep the WebView/TTS/Magisk APKs beside the Chrome version folders, then set `CHROME_APK` to a Chrome split-APK version directory, for example:

   ```python
   CHROME_APK = "/home/damru/chrome-apks/145.0.7632.75"
   ```

   Manual Linux/WSL extraction example:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /home/damru
   sudo chown "$USER:$USER" /home/damru
   unzip damru-chrome-apks-latest.zip -d /home/damru/chrome-apks
   find /home/damru/chrome-apks -maxdepth 2 -name '*.apk' | head
   ```

   ```python
   # None = auto-searches the 'chrome-apks/' directory in the project root
   CHROME_APK = None  
   # Or specify an absolute path:
   # CHROME_APK = "/mnt/c/path/to/damru/chrome-apks/145.0.7632.75"
   ```

   When `CHROME_APK = None` and the bundle exists, random profile actions can also rotate to another validated Chrome/WebView-matched APK version so the Chrome major/minor version follows the selected profile instead of staying fixed forever.

3. **Pool Settings (`NUM_DEVICES` & `MODE`)**:
   ```python
   MODE = "auto"          # "auto" = manages Docker containers; "mumu" = local VMs; "manual" = ADB
   NUM_DEVICES = 10       # How many concurrent containers to spin up/maintain
   REDROID_IMAGE = "damru-redroid:latest"  # The Docker image to use
   ```

4. **Proxy, Timezone, and Locale**:
Leave `TIMEZONE` and `LOCALE` as `None` unless you intentionally need fixed values. Damru resolves the active proxy exit at session start, then applies matching Android timezone, Chrome timezone, `Accept-Language`, and `Intl` locale. Rotating residential proxies are rechecked through Chrome after CDP connects so the browser does not keep a stale timezone from a previous exit.

Auto locale selection covers standard ISO country codes plus CLDR exceptional territory codes. Countries with more than one realistic phone/browser language can rotate between valid local variants, for example `en-PH` / `fil-PH` or `en-IN` / `hi-IN`.
   ```python
   PROXY = None        # Optional: SOCKS5/HTTP proxy URL for Python-side checks
   HTTP_PROXY = None   # Optional: Android system HTTP proxy as host:port
   TIMEZONE = None     # Auto from proxy exit when unset
   LOCALE = None       # Auto from proxy country when unset
   ```

   Authenticated HTTP and SOCKS5 proxies are supported. Damru automatically starts a local no-auth bridge when Android cannot store proxy credentials directly, then points Android Chrome at that bridge. This avoids Chrome proxy sign-in dialogs while keeping proxy-based timezone, locale, and WebRTC leak guards active. Advanced users can still pass an explicit `HTTP_PROXY`/`http_proxy` bridge endpoint when they manage their own proxy bridge.

### Docker Storage Location (Crucial for Windows Users)
Redroid containers consume significant disk space. If you are using WSL2 Docker, it saves data to your `ext4.vhdx` virtual drive on the `C:` drive by default, which can quickly fill up your primary SSD.

**To save Docker images to a secondary HDD:**
You must configure the Docker daemon inside WSL to use a different data-root.
1. Open WSL (`wsl -d Ubuntu`).
2. Stop docker: `sudo service docker stop`.
3. Move existing data to your HDD: `sudo mv /var/lib/docker /mnt/d/docker-data`.
4. Symlink it back: `sudo ln -s /mnt/d/docker-data /var/lib/docker`.
5. Start docker: `sudo service docker start`.

*(Note: Native `DOCKER_STORAGE_PATH` configuration via Python is on the upcoming roadmap).*

## Experimental Features

Damru has optional flags for sensors, battery, and browser-level controls.
Set any before running Damru:

`ash
export DAMRU_EXPERIMENTAL_SENSOR_HAL=1   # Linux/WSL
 = 1  # Windows PowerShell
`

### Choose your sensor path

| Flag | What it does | When to use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| DAMRU_EXPERIMENTAL_SENSOR_HAL=1 | **Native Android sensors** (gyro/accel/mag). Streams real-looking data at 50-100Hz. Requires baking the sensor HAL into the image once. | **Best stealth** — most realistic |
| DAMRU_EXPERIMENTAL_HIDL_SENSOR_HAL=1 | Same but uses older Android HIDL interface instead of AIDL. | Fallback if AIDL is broken on your image |
| DAMRU_ENABLE_NATIVE_SENSOR_HAL=1 | **Activates** the sensor HAL at container start. Required if you baked with SENSOR_HAL. | Always needed with SENSOR_HAL |
| DAMRU_EXPERIMENTAL_CDP_SENSORS=1 | **Browser-level faking** via Chrome DevTools Protocol. Generic readings, no hardware stream. No image rebuild needed. | Quick tests, no-image-change needed |

### Battery spoof

| Flag | What it does | When to use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| DAMRU_EXPERIMENTAL_BATTERY_DUMPSYS=1 | Force battery spoof via Android dumpsys on Redroid | If you need battery level/charging state |
| DAMRU_EXPERIMENTAL_BATTERY_SPOOF=1 | Alternative via settings put global | If dumpsys path doesn't work |

### Browser / Worker

| Flag | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| DAMRU_EXPERIMENTAL_WORKER_CORE_CDP=1 | Enable CDP worker-target auto-attach for multi-threaded JS. May destabilise Chrome. |
| DAMRU_EXPERIMENTAL_RAW_WORKER_CDP=1 | Skip reattach flow, keep raw CDP attached. Auto-set by --mode cdp. |

### Profile tiers

Default random selection uses premium pool only. To include lower-confidence profiles:

`ash
export DAMRU_PROFILE_TIER=all
# or --profile-tier all
`

Tiers: premium (default), premium_verified, premium_new, medium, experimental, extended, ll.

> **Status:** Sensor HAL validated on WSL Redroid Android 14 with Chrome and WebView Shell. Battery and CDP sensor flags are exploratory.

## Usage & Examples

Damru handles the heavy lifting: it connects to ADB, gains root, applies system patches, spoofs the GPU, launches Chrome, and attaches via CDP-all automatically.

### Example 1: Basic Async Usage (The Standard Way)

```python
import asyncio
from damru import AsyncDamru

async def main():
    print("Launching Damru...")
    
# device="random" picks from 155 real Android device profiles.
    # Leave timezone/locale unset so Damru follows the active proxy exit.
    async with AsyncDamru(
        device="random", 
        proxy="socks5://your.proxy.ip:1080",
        debug=True
    ) as browser:
        
        # 'browser' is a standard Playwright BrowserContext!
        page = await browser.new_page()
        
        print("Navigating to CreepJS to test stealth...")
        await page.goto("https://abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs/")
        await page.wait_for_timeout(10000)
        await page.screenshot(path="creepjs_score.png")
        print("Done! Check creepjs_score.png")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Example 1b: Authenticated Proxy with Android HTTP Bridge

Android system proxy supports HTTP CONNECT. If your provider gives SOCKS5 for Python-side checks but Android Chrome must use a local HTTP bridge, pass both values:

```python
from damru import AsyncDamru

async with AsyncDamru(
    device="pixel_8_pro",
    proxy="socks5://user:pass@proxy.example:824",
    http_proxy="172.17.0.1:18888",
) as browser:
    page = await browser.new_page()
    await page.goto("https://demo.fingerprint.com/playground")
```

Damru resolves timezone and locale through `http_proxy` because that is the route Chrome actually uses. Do not set `timezone` or `locale` manually unless they match the current proxy exit.

### Example 2: Synchronous Usage

If you prefer synchronous code, Damru provides a blocking wrapper:

```python
from damru import Damru

def run_sync():
    with Damru(device="pixel_8_pro") as browser:
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto("https://bot.sannysoft.com/")
        page.wait_for_timeout(5000)
        page.screenshot(path="sannysoft.png")
        print("Passed Sannysoft!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_sync()
```

### Example 3: Scaling Up with Connection Pooling

Scraping thousands of pages Damru provides a native Pool manager to run operations concurrently across multiple Docker containers.

```python
from damru import DamruPoolSync

proxies = [
    "socks5://proxy1:1080",
    "socks5://proxy2:1080",
    "socks5://proxy3:1080"
]

with DamruPoolSync(mode="auto", max_devices=3, proxies=proxies) as pool:
    for i in range(3):
        with pool.session() as context:
            page = context.new_page()
            page.goto("https://example.com/api/scrape_target")
            print(f"Worker {i} finished scraping: {page.title()}")
```

---

### Example 5: Using DamruPool for Multi-Device Automation

```python
import asyncio
from damru import DamruPool

async def main():
    # Pool manages N workers (default: NUM_DEVICES from config, or up to 10)
    # Each session gets a fresh random fingerprint with full stealth
    proxy = "socks5://user:pass@residential-proxy.com:1080"
    async with DamruPool(max_devices=2) as pool:
        # session() yields a Playwright BrowserContext with full stealth applied
        async with pool.session() as ctx:
            page = await ctx.new_page()
            await page.goto("https://example.com")
            print(await page.title())

        # Or use the convenience wrapper for one-shot navigation:
        title = await pool.open_url("127.0.0.1:5600", "https://shopee.com.br/", proxy=proxy)
        print(f"Title: {title}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Testing Your Setup

Start with the fast readiness and Android sanity checks before running full benchmarks:

```bash
python -m damru check preflight
python -m damru check-env
python -m damru quick-check --serial 127.0.0.1:5600
```

Damru also ships with a benchmark suite for proof/stealth checks:

```bash
# Run all benchmark tests on a random device
python -m damru benchmark --device random

# Run specific tests with a proxy
python -m damru benchmark --device samsung_galaxy_s24_ultra --proxy socks5://ip:port --tests creepjs cloudflare
```

## The "Big Plan" (Roadmap)

We are aggressively building Damru into a fully autonomous infrastructure tool. Check `https://github.com/akwin1234/damru/wiki/Troubleshooting-and-FAQ` for details.

*   [x] **`damru setup` CLI**: Single-command configuration plus Linux/WSL dependency setup.
*   [x] **Automated Health Checks**: Verification of ADB, Docker, binderfs, Chrome APKs, images, Playwright patches, resources, ports, and WSL kernel state.
*   [x] **Fleet Preflight**: Fast read-only `check preflight` command with JSON and strict modes for many VPS/VM hosts.
*   [x] **Manual Viewer Tools**: Optional screenshots, video recording, and scrcpy live viewer.
*   [x] **Experimental Local UI**: Localhost setup dashboard, worker controls, Work Lab actions, viewer, logs, and gallery cleanup.
*   [x] **Auto Image/APK Management**: `install-image`, `install-apks`, raw APK bundle discovery, and image baking commands.
*   [ ] **Packaging polish**: More release automation, smaller proof packs, clearer issue templates, and better first-run UI guidance.

## Changelog (v0.1.0-beta ? v1.2)

- **WebView version matching**: Relaxed to match on first 3 version segments (x.y.z) allowing minor build skew between Chrome and WebView APKs
- **APK version selection**: `_preferred_chrome_apk_version_dir` now prefers Chrome versions that have a matching `webview.apk` in their directory
- **Image download**: `install-image --download` now accepts direct HTTPS URLs in addition to Google Drive links
- **Bake image cleanup**: Pre-commit cleanup removes temp APKs, dalvik-cache, logs, etc. reducing baked image size
- **WSL serial compatibility**: `wsl:` serial prefix is automatically stripped on Linux hosts
- **Sensor HAL bake**: Missing AIDL compiler no longer breaks `bake-image` — sensor HAL install is skipped gracefully
- **Worker default cap**: Raised from 3 to 10 when NUM_DEVICES is unset
- **Pool API**: Added `open_url()` convenience method for one-shot stealth navigation

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Does Damru support physical Android devices
**No.** Damru is designed strictly for containerized environments (Redroid). Its low-level OS patches, `resetprop` logic, and binary driver injections are optimized for Redroid's kernel and filesystem. **Do not attempt to use Damru on your personal phone.** Auto-detection refuses physical-looking USB serials by default. `DAMRU_ALLOW_PHYSICAL=1` is only for intentionally disposable test devices, entirely at your own risk.

### 2. Can I use MuMu Player instead of Docker
MuMu Player support is currently an **experimental, unfinished, and non-functional beta feature**. While the code structure for it exists, we highly recommend using **Redroid (Docker)** for any production or serious research work.

### 3. Why is the .tar image so large
The `damru-redroid-latest.tar` image is a full Android 14 operating system export. The current test artifact is about 915 MB as a Docker tarball and expands to a larger Docker image after `docker load`. It includes pre-installed Chrome, TTS assets, custom fonts, and pre-patched binary drivers for faster deployment.

### 4. Does Damru work on native Linux
**Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is the only officially supported native Linux target today.** Other distributions may run Docker, but Damru Redroid reliability depends on kernel binderfs and container networking behavior. Debian 13 was tested and is not supported yet because its stock kernel did not provide the binderfs support needed for reliable multi-container Redroid.

### 5. Why "Zero JS Injection"
Standard stealth tools are caught by anti-bots because their JavaScript injections leave traces (timing, prototype pollution). Damru lies from the outside-in (OS, Binary, and Protocol levels), making it mathematically invisible to scripts.

## Support Damru

Damru is not a wrapper around a normal browser. It is a native Android automation stack with patched profiles, Chrome/WebView version alignment, rooted Redroid workers, TLS experiments, proxy validation, benchmark proof runs, and a local UI. Keeping that working takes paid compute, AI research credits, proxy testing, storage, RAM, and time.

If Damru helped you avoid days of setup, debugging, fingerprint leaks, or broken Android automation, please support the project:
