"""Playwright crPage.js stealth patch for damru.

This module patches Playwright's Chromium crPage.js to add a Runtime
enable/disable dance controlled by the PLAYWRIGHT_STEALTH_RUNTIME env var.

The patch is idempotent: it detects whether the installed crPage.js already
contains the stealth modifications and skips patching if so.

How it works:
  - On import, ``ensure_patched()`` locates the installed playwright package's
    crPage.js (at ``playwright/driver/package/lib/server/chromium/crPage.js``).
  - It checks whether the file already contains the ``PLAYWRIGHT_STEALTH_RUNTIME``
    marker string.  If yes, it is already patched and nothing happens.
  - If not, it copies the bundled (pre-patched) crPage.js from this directory
    over the installed version.
  - A SHA-256 hash comparison is done first so we only write when the content
    actually differs.
