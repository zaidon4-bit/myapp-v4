#  Damru Core Library (`damru/`)

> Part of **Damru** — the open-source, Android-native stealth browser automation framework (Redroid + Playwright + CDP) for web scraping, automation testing, and anti-bot / fingerprinting research.

*Core Python library for Android-native stealth browser automation.*

Welcome to the heart of the Damru framework. This directory contains the main Python source code responsible for orchestrating the entire lifecycle of the spoofing process. 

Our core philosophy here is **"Zero JS Injection"**. Every spoof is executed natively or at the protocol level.

## Architecture Overview

The library is modular and highly specialized:

*   **`async_core.py` & `core.py`**: The main entry points (Async and Sync context managers). These manage the connection flow: `ADB detection -> Rooting -> Applying OS Props -> Patching GPU -> Launching Chrome -> Attaching CDP`.
*   **`devices.py`**: A massive built-in database of 155 real Android devices. It holds hardware specs, Chrome-visible memory/core buckets, screen resolutions, GPU renderers, OS props, and build fingerprints to keep spoofing physically coherent.
*   **`root.py`**: Executes the **Layer 1 (OS)** and **Layer 2 (Binary)** stealth patches via ADB shell using `su`. It modifies `build.prop`, pushes custom GPU `.so` files, and manages `iptables` for WebRTC/IPv6 blocking.
*   **`cdp.py`**: Handles the connection to the Chrome DevTools Protocol, securely forwarding ports from the Android emulator to `localhost`.
*   **`chrome.py`**: Manages the Chrome browser lifecycle on the device. It handles clearing app data, dismissing the First Run Experience (FRE), and injecting our **Layer 4** stealth patches directly into Chrome's `Preferences` JSON file.
*   **`proxy.py`**: Parses incoming proxy strings and uses them to dynamically map Timezones, Geolocation, and Locales so the browser's identity matches the IP's physical origin.
*   **`pool.py`**: Connection pooling managers (`DamruPool`, `DamruPoolSync`) designed for scaling operations concurrently across multiple Docker containers.
*   **`cli.py`**: User-facing setup, preflight, environment checks, image/APK management, image baking, WSL/internet repair, worker helper actions, profile forcing, screenshot/video capture, and optional viewer commands.
*   **`profile_apply.py`**: Deterministic profile application helper for forcing a named device identity onto an existing rooted ADB worker.
*   **`ui/`**: Experimental localhost dashboard static assets and allowlisted backend for setup health, workers, Work Lab, browser viewer, gallery cleanup, and logs.
*   **`playwright_patch/`**: Contains `crPage.js` modifications that are dynamically loaded to neutralize Playwright's default behavior, preventing CDP target discovery leaks.

> **Note to Developers:** When modifying the core, remember to avoid relying on JavaScript-based evasions. Always look for OS-level or CDP-level solutions first.
